# Red-Green-Up-Down
Simple game devolved with Swift UI with swiping and fast thinking to get ahead in points.

Interactive Gameplay: Created a simple yet engaging game with four images where players must swipe left or right based on the color and direction of an arrow, earning points for correct swipes and losing a point for incorrect ones.
Dynamic Scoring System: Implemented a combo score that increases with consecutive correct swipes and resets upon an incorrect swipe, encouraging players to maintain accuracy for higher scores.
Time-Limited Challenge: Designed the game with a 10-second countdown, adding a time pressure element that intensifies the challenge. Upon reaching the time limit, the game resets, offering players a quick and enjoyable experience.
Efficient Functionality: Leveraged Swift functions to handle core game mechanics, including swiping, countdown management, and random assignment of images. Integrated built-in Swift packages for seamless device touch input, ensuring responsive and intuitive gameplay.
